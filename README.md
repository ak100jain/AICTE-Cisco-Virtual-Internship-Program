# AICTE Cisco Virtual Internship - Cloud Security

## Overview

This repository contains the project and resources related to my participation in the **AICTE Cisco Virtual Internship**, where I successfully completed the **Cisco Cloud Security** course. The course provided hands-on experience and detailed knowledge about cloud security principles and practices.

## Course Description

   - Cloud Deployment Models
   - Shared Responsibilities in Cloud

2. **Infrastructure Security for Cloud**
   - Network Security in Cloud
   - Securing Compute Workloads
   - Management Plane Security
   - Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

3. **Managing Cloud Security & Risk**
   - Governance and Risk Management
   - Cloud Compliance and Legal Considerations
   - Auditing Cloud Infrastructure
   - CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) Tools

4. **Data Security for Cloud**
   - Securing Data in Cloud Environments
   - Encryption Techniques for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
   - Data Security Lifecycle and Key Management

5. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**
   - Secure Operations, DevOps, and Testing
   - Identity and Access Management (IAM)

6. **Cloud Security Operations**
   - Selecting a Secure Cloud Provider
   - Incident Response in Cloud
   - Security as a Service (SECaaS) Fundamentals

## Real-World Project

Upon successfully completing the **Cisco Cloud Security** course and obtaining my certification, I was tasked with solving a **real-world problem** designed to apply the knowledge gained throughout the course. The problem statement focused on **securely hosting and managing student and faculty data for a college** using cloud services.

### Problem Statement:
The project involved creating a secure, scalable, and efficient cloud infrastructure to store and manage sensitive information such as student and faculty details, including personal data, academic records, and contact information. The data needed to be protected from unauthorized access while ensuring availability and easy access for authorized users.

### Key Requirements:
1. **Data Security**: Ensure that all sensitive information is securely stored in the cloud with **encryption at rest and in transit**. Implement robust access control mechanisms to limit data access to authorized personnel only.
   
2. **Scalability**: The solution should be capable of handling a large number of records and scaling automatically based on the system's usage, ensuring smooth performance even during peak times (e.g., enrollment periods).
   
3. **Compliance**: The infrastructure must adhere to industry standards and **regulatory compliance**, ensuring data privacy and protection as per legal and educational institution guidelines (e.g., FERPA, GDPR).
   
4. **Disaster Recovery and Backup**: Implement a backup strategy to ensure data recovery in case of system failures or breaches. The cloud setup should have a **Business Continuity Plan** to maintain data availability during disruptions.
   
5. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different levels of access for administrators, faculty, and students should be defined and implemented using **Role-Based Access Control** (RBAC). This ensures that each user type has only the necessary permissions for their tasks.

6. **Monitoring and Incident Response**: Set up a cloud monitoring and logging mechanism to detect suspicious activities, enforce security policies, and respond to any incidents or breaches in a timely manner.

### Solution Approach:
Using the principles learned during the course, I designed and implemented a **cloud-based infrastructure** that met all the project requirements. This solution included:

- **AWS Services**: Leveraging AWS for secure cloud storage, compute resources, and automatic scaling.
  - **Amazon RDS** was used for storing sensitive data securely with encryption at rest.
  - **Amazon S3** for scalable data storage with versioning and lifecycle policies for backups.
  - **IAM (Identity Access Management)** for defining and enforcing RBAC policies.
  - **CloudTrail** for auditing access and activities across the cloud environment.
  - **AWS KMS** for managing encryption keys securely.
  
- **Security Implementation**: Data encryption was enforced both at rest (using **AWS KMS**) and during transmission (using **SSL/TLS protocols**). Detailed security policies were set to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
  
- **Compliance and Governance**: Best practices were applied to ensure that the system complied with data protection laws, including periodic audits, encryption key rotation, and ensuring secure handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
  
- **Backup and Recovery**: A disaster recovery plan was designed with automated backups in **Amazon S3**, with cross-region replication to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### Outcome:
The project provided a comprehensive, secure, and scalable cloud solution, successfully addressing the challenge of securely hosting and managing student and faculty data. The solution ensured data protection, compliance, and efficient access controls. The project was completed under the guidance of an experienced mentor and received positive feedback for its robust security architecture.
